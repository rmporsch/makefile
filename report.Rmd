# The Data

Daily readings of the following air quality values for May 1, 1973 (a Tuesday) to September 30, 1973 in New York City.

# Descriptive Stats


## Histogram

As you can see in the histogram shows some form of distribution. 
This text is actually here to give some form of contextual information.
However, since this analysis is pretty trivial I will just write some bullshit here.

# Temperature Over Time

Similar, one can see here the temperature change across the two analysed years.
Nothing special here to report.

```{r, results='asis', message=F, echo=F, fig.align='left', fig.cap="Temperature over Time"}
dat <- read.csv("formated_data.csv")
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(dat, aes(x=X, y=TempC)) +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Days") +
  ylab("Temperature (in C)")
```
